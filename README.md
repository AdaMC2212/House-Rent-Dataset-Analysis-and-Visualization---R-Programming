This is a HouseRent Dataset Analysis and Visualization created R programming language.

## Scenario

It contains over 4700 rows and 12 columns. In addition to the techniques (data exploration, manipulation, transformation, and visualization techniques) covered in the course to analyze the dataset, you might consider to explore and implement more advanced concepts to enhance the effectiveness of data retrieval.
