# House Rent Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This is a HouseRent Dataset Analysis and Visualization created R programming language.

## Scenario

This dataset contains the details of varied house rents that could determine how people have an impact to choose the houses for rental based on their lifestyle. Human Rights Measurement team assigned you to perform analysis with the given dataset to identify the how people choose their rental house based on their family background, locality and lifestyle and provide meaningful insight for decision making. 

For the assignment, you are asked to explore the application of data analytics techniques to the dataset which is provided. You must study data problems related to the dataset, giving special consideration to the unique properties of the problem domain, and testing one or more techniques on it.

Your analysis needs to be thorough and comprehensive, and goes beyond the scope of what has been covered in this course. You should incorporate data exploration, manipulation, transformation, and visualization concepts with data analysis techniques in your solution. It is crucial to provide explanations and justifications for the chosen techniques.

You also may need to pre-process your data to get it into an appropriate format. The assignment should involve a number of techniques by categorize it into different criteria and a detailed exploration with the commands using in each criteria. Outline the findings, analyze them and justify correctly with an appropriate graph. Also, a supporting document is needed to reflect the graph and code using R programming concepts.


## Techniques

The dataset provided for this assignment consists of information about Houses/Apartments/Flats Available for Rent, including parameters such as BHK, Rent, Size, No. of Floors, Area Type, Area Locality, City, Furnishing Status, Type of Tenant Preferred, No. of Bathrooms, and Point of Contact. It contains over 4700 rows and 12 columns. In addition to the techniques (data exploration, manipulation, transformation, and visualization techniques) covered in the course to analyze the dataset, you might consider to explore and implement more advanced concepts to enhance the effectiveness of data retrieval.

## Objective

1. To find the relationship between tenant preferred and rental price.  
2. To find the impact of rent based on the furnishing status of the properties.  
3. To investigate the impact of the contact and rental price.  
3. To find the impact of property size on the rental price.
